# 42 AI & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to **`troudot-42-ai-ml-spec`** ‚Äî a collection of hands-on projects exploring the fundamentals and applications of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**.  
Each repository demonstrates a different concept, built from scratch to deepen understanding of algorithms, data processing, and model evaluation.

## üìÇ Projects

- **[linear_regression](https://github.com/troudot-42-ai-ml-spec/linear_regression)**
  Implementation of linear regression from scratch with gradient descent, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation.

- **[dslr](https://github.com/troudot-42-ai-ml-spec/dslr)**  
  Logistic regression classifier with exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

*(More projects coming soon...)*

## üéØ Goals

- Build core AI/ML algorithms from scratch.
- Develop practical data preprocessing and visualization skills.
- Apply statistical thinking to machine learning problems.
- Create clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (when allowed)  
- **Approach:** From-scratch implementations before using high-level ML frameworks.
